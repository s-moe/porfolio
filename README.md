For Arthur:
I would like help understanding/getting a refresher on:
- The parent passes a function as props to the sender to alter the parents state
- The parent passes the state itself as a prop to the receiver to receive the updated state
- Context
- props.children
What I'd like to improve upon for my Project 3:
- adding a logout function
- creating a profile page that the user can update/edit
- organizing my login and signup pages - changing the functionality to be components that render on
those pages
- not rendering the signup and login components once the user is signed in, but instead redirecting to the
create listings page and/or the profile page
- creating a search function that allows users to search for registries based on email and render the
registry associated with that email
- creating a buy button/shopping cart component
